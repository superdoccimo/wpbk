How to Launch WordPress Using setup.sh
To easily launch WordPress on a Red Hat-based system like AlmaLinux, follow these steps. After setting the appropriate permissions, you can simply run the setup.sh script to successfully configure and launch WordPress.

Instructions:

Make the setup.sh script executable:

chmod +x setup.sh

Run the script:

./setup.sh

The script will perform the following actions:

Create the WordPress directory if it doesn't exist.
Set the correct ownership (UID 33, GID 33) and permissions for the WordPress directory.
Build and start the Docker containers for WordPress.
Check the health status of the container.
Once the container is running, adjust the ownership of the WordPress directory again to ensure proper access.
After executing ./setup.sh, WordPress will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
